Worked with object-oriented programming constructs including classes and objects by building classes to represent creatures in a cataloguing system. <br>
- In Python, used the import keyword to make code in one module available in another 
- Reuse code while keeping your projects maintainable

## Pakuri Class
This class will be the blueprint for the different critter objects that you will create. <br>

## Pakudex Class 
The Pakudex class will contain all the pakuri that you will encounter as Pakuri objects. <br>
